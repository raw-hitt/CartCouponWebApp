This project is created for a coupon code logic considering the following problem statement
Problem Statement:- 
The following items in the shopping cart:

 

Item    Qty     Price/Item

Shirt   3       1000

Trouser 4       2000

Shoes   2       3000

Ties    10      1000

 

It should be possible for us to calculate and add coupon discounts to generate the final bill amount. Discount scenarios are as follows:

 

1. Type-1:  Discount on all items. e.g: Flat 10% discount on all items

2. Type-2: Discount on next item. e.g: If I add a coupon of 10% after trousers, only shoes will be discounted. 

3. Type-3: Fixed discount on nth item in cart. e.g: Every 5th item will be free per item category.
